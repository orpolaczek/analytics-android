## Snapshots

All changes committed to master are automatically released as snapshots.

To add a snapshot dependency to your builds, make sure you add the snapshot repository so your build system can look up the dependency.

Maven users can add the following to their `pom.xml`:
```
<repository>
    <id>ossrh</id>
    <name>Sonatype Snapshot Repository</name>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
    <releases>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
</repository>
```

Gradle users should declare this in their repositories block:
```
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }
}
```
